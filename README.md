The Short Term Plan...

. Create a web page that acts as a dashboard for users to see activities that they can or cannot do based on upcoming weather predictions. 
. Have a list of activites the user can select from to narrow down which kind of notifications they'd like to receive.
. Show at least a 5 day window of activities or alerts based on the weather. 
. Eventually create user logins to allow tailored experiences.
. Allow the user to select specific days if needed. 
. Weather predictions will come from a weather API. 


The Long Term Plan...
. Turn this into an app that sends alerts based on user input against future weather forcasts.
